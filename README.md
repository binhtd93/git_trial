# IMDB Movie Analysis

## Business problem:

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

#### Questions of interest:

1. What kinds of movies Microsoft should produce ?
   - What genres have been doing well over the last 5 years / 10 years ?
   - Average gross bookings for each of the genres ?  
   - Which are the top directors in terms of popularity over the past 10 years ?

2. Movie industry landscape
   - Which are some of the major studios ? Annual gross bookings per each player ?
   - Trends in terms of average gross bookings and average production cost over time 
   - Correlation btw average gross bookings and production cost  


## Data

The analysis is based on database from IMDB
